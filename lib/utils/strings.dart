    'The partition of the Indian Sub-continent resulted in the creation of one of the largest predominantly Muslim states in the world, known as Pakistan.'
    ' The Christians of the sub-continent who were living in the part that became Pakistan felt the need to answer questions like:'
    ' "Who are we? What do we believe? Why are we different from others?" Dennis E. Clark, a Canadian missionary, realized that these questions needed to be answered, not only for the existence of'
    ' Christianity in Pakistan, but also for the Church to flourish in this newly born Muslim state. The most effective way to answer these issues was to print books that could help Christians grow'
    ' in their faith. Thus in 1948, after much effort a building was rented at 36 Ferozepur Road, Lahore and the publishing house, under the name of MASIHI ISHAâ€™AT KHANA '
    '("The Christian Publishing House") was started. Work continued in this building until July 2003, when the publishing house moved into a spacious and modern new office, built on the same site.'
    ' During these many years of serving the Lord in the field of literature,MIK has produced numerous books for evangelism and Christian growth.';
